In games, we need a lot of randomly generated things. We can do this with the random library in python:

import random

because we are already calling import pygame, we can actually do:

import pygame, random

and that will work just fine. In order to create a random number we call:

random.randint(int,int)

which will create a random number in between the two ints, including both endpoints. 

ASSIGNMENT:

There really is nothing to do but add random to your file, if you want.
