Before we do anything with our rectangle, we need to define the FPS we want our game to run at. Otherwise, it will 
run as fast as your computer can handle. This is again, very simple. First, outside of the loop, assign a variable
that has the value of pygame.time.Clock(), like this:

clock = pygame.time.Clock()

Then, inside our loop we simply call:

clock.tick(fps)

with fps equal to the number of frames we want our game to run at. 60 is ideal.

ASSIGNMENT:

assign the FPS of your game to 60.
