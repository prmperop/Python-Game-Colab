Assignment 7 may be a little hard to complete. Just in case, i created a cheat sheet that follows only the ways
that have been taught to you. try to do it on your own, but if you cant, heres one of the possible answers. 
Reminder that you cannot simply copy and paste this code into IDLE because of how notepad handles spaces and tabs.
This is intentional. you need to type it yourself in order to learn how to do it on your own.

import pygame
pygame.init

screensize = (640,480)
screen = pygame.display.set_mode(screensize)
playerRect = pygame.Rect(150,150,50,50)
running = True

screen.fill((0,0,0))
pygame.display.update()

while Running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
	if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
	    quit()
	if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
	    if event.key == pygame.K_w:
		playerRect.move(0,-5)
	    if event.key == pygame.K_s:
		playerRect.move(0,5)
	    if event.key == pygame.K_a:
		playerRect.move(-5,0)
	    if event.key == pygame.K_d:
		playerRect.move(5,0)
    screen.fill(255,255,255)
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, (100,100,100), playerRect)
    pygame.display.update()
