You may have heard the word sprite. No, not the soda, a sprite is an image used in a game. The first thing i have to 
explain is what a surface is. A surface is like a piece of paper that you can do shit on. There's one special surface:
the surface that is created when we do:

pygame.display.set_mode(screensize)

This is like your poster paper. When we draw rects on, we are like glueing pieces of paper on our poster. When we 
update the screen, we are like making the stuff visible. There are other ways to get our peices of paper on the poster,
and what these papers are depends on how we make them. Now back to sprites. Whenever we initialize a sprite, we are
creating a surface object. We do this by doing:

spriteName = pygame.image.load('ImageName.png')
spriteName.convert()

the .convert isnt NEEDED, but it makes everything better by changing the pixel format. What does this mean? i dunno.
just do it. Anyways, we cant to pygame.draw for this peice of paper. Instead, we can do:

PosterPaperName.blit(spriteName, (x,y))

WE STILL NEED TO UPDATE THIS STUFF!!!! It will not automatically update itself. A sprite cannot be used like a rect,
so it's better to have an invisible rect under the sprite and use the rect to detect stuff like collision.

ASSIGNMENT:

update your player class to use sprites.
