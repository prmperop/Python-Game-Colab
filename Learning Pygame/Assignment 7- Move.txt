Our rectangle isnt very exciting, is it? What if we moved it? We can do so with the command:

pygame.Rect.move_ip(int,int)

which will move our rectangle by the amount provided. This assignment will be harder!

ASSIGNMENT:

Make your rect a variable, if it isnt already. Add a loop to your file that makes it so when you press any of the 
wasd keys, your rect moves in that direction. Rembember that 0,0 is the top left corner, and that your rectangle
is drawn from the top left. 

A file called 'CHEAT SHEET - 7' is located in the folder, which has a possible solution in it. Also, we only want 
the rect to move a little bit, not constantly. That is harder to do, and i will show you how to do that in the next
assignment/lesson thingeroo.
