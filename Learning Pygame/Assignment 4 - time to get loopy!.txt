This assignment is going to be a little bit longer, because the concept is a little larger. The first thing we 
are going to talk about is game loops. If we run only one frame of our game, it would be a pretty bad game. So,
we are going to start with a loop. We need to first assign a variable, which I usually call 'running', to True. 
then, we create our 'while' loop. while running, we need to make something happen. We are actually going to call 
another loop inside our loop (loopy!), but this time, its going to be a 'for' loop. Let's start out with making our
game be able to close, so we need a loop that gets our inputs. Inputs are anything from key presses to mouse 
movements to exits. What is an exit? That little 'x' in the top corner of this window is an exit. When we press it,
it calls the exit function from this window. Our window doesn't have any specific function to call when we 'exit'.
in order to start our inputs in our mapping, we pull the following:

for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
        if event.key == pygame.K_a:
            None

I went a little ham on that one, but its pretty simple to understand. In this case, instead of KEYDOWN we would put
QUIT, and then we would skip the key check. We could do a few things, such as quit our loop by setting running to 
False or simply quit the window by calling 'quit()' We can put a few other things in the KEYDOWN spot, such as 
MOUSEBUTTONDOWN, MOUSEBUTTONUP, KEYUP, or a bunch of joystick commands which i doubt i'll ever use. All of these 
things can be found on pygame.org/docs, as well as a bunch of other stuff which includes syntax and stuff. It is
well documented, but it can be overwhelming at first. 

ASSIGNMENT:

add a loop into your file that, when you press the exit button, quits the window.
