The way we looked at previously for event handling is... a little shitty, to be completely honest. Theres TWO ways to
handle events with pygame. Theres the for loop we looked at, which is better for not missing a single input. This is
needed for things like typing or text editors, where we need every single input. However, for games, its okay if we
miss one or two for the sake of speed and stuff. The second way is to check what key is CURRENTLY pressed, and then do
stuff based on that. We would want to do this to see what is pressed:

VariableName = pygame.key.get_pressed()

This will give you a massive list of every key on the keyboard, and if it is pressed or not. How do we use this? well,
we would do:

if VariableName[keyIndexNumber] == True:
	do something

We do this for every key we need to see if is checked. We only need to call pygame.key.get_pressed() once per frame, 
which will do fine.

The keyNumberIndex, as far as i can tell, must be found by yourself. If you feel ambitious, you can try to figure it
out, but i figured these out:

a = 97
d = 100
w = 119
s = 115
LeftArrow = 276
RightArrow = 275
UpArrow = 274
DownArrow = 273
SpaceBar = 32
RightCtrl = 303
Esc = 27
