Now that we have a file, we need to use pygame in it. Pygame is a library, so we need to import it first.
start with:

import pygame

Then, we need to initialize pygame. to do that, create the line:

pygame.init()

This initializes all of the parts of pygame. In bigger games, where resources are critical, we would initialize each
module as we need them in order to save space, due to the fact that a lot of modules are initialized that we dont
need (like the joystick). For now, its not critical. Look on www.pygame.org/docs to see how to initialize certain part
and decide what you do and do not. (Do this later if you want)

ASSIGNMENT:

modify your file so that it imports and then initizalizes python. Then run it. (if it raises an error, pygame is 
intalled incorrectly.)
